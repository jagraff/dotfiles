Do the following steps in order:

1. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Read the current CLAUDE.md in the project root. Review the codebase for any changes that should be reflected (new files, changed conventions, updated setup steps, etc.). Update CLAUDE.md to accurately describe the current state of the project. If no CLAUDE.md exists, create one.

2. **Commit everything**: Stage all changes (including the CLAUDE.md update) and create a commit. Follow the repository's existing commit message style based on recent git log.

3. **Push**: Push the commit to the remote.
